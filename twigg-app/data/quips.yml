- "Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."
- "The three chief virtues of a programmer are: laziness, impatience and hubris."
- A program that produces incorrect results twice as fast is infinitely slower.
- Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
- Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
- Before I step into a puddle, I'd like to know how deep it is.
- Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.
- Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does.
- Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.
- Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.
- Deleted code is debugged code.
- Depth before breadth.
- Done is better than perfect.
- Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.
- I hate code, and I want as little of it as possible in our product.
- I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.
- If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
- If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter how fast it doesn’t work.
- If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.
- In programming the hard part isn’t solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve.
- Leave it better.
- Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.
- Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
- No code is faster than no code.
- Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
- Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
- Programming can be fun, so can cryptography; however they should not be combined.
- Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
- Real artists ship.
- Seek first to understand, and then be understood.
- Ship early and often.
- Simplicity carried to the extreme becomes elegance.
- Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
- The best way to predict the future is to implement it.
- The central enemy of reliability is complexity.
- The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren't there.
- The computing scientist's main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.
- The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time.
- The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.
- The unavoidable price of reliability is simplicity.
- The whole point of getting things done is knowing what to leave undone.
- When in doubt, leave it out.
- You have to break eggs to make an omelet.
