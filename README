Quant collects statistics for a set of git repositories. It assumes that
all the repositories are in one directory and up-to-date.

# ./bin/commit-stats

A script to show how many commits each person has made in a given
timespan and in what repositories.

# The Web App

The web app shows the same information as ./bin/commit-stats. To run it,
copy config.yml.example to config.yml and set `repositories_directory`
to the directory that contains all the repositories you want to analyze.
