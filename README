Twig collects statistics for a set of Git repositories. It assumes that
all the repositories are in one directory and up-to-date.

# twig-stats (command-line tool)

A script to show how many commits each person has made in a given
timespan and in what repositories.

Usage:

    twig-stats [--verbose|-v] repos dir> <number of days>

# twig-app (web app)

The web app shows the same information as `twig-stats`. To run it,
copy `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` and set `repositories_directory`
to the directory that contains all the repositories you want to analyze.

Usage:

    twig-app
